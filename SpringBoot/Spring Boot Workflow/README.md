# Spring Boot Workflow

A Spring Boot workflow can be understood in two main contexts:  

1. **The startup process of the application**  
2. **The lifecycle of handling a web request**  

Spring Boot's core principles—**auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and a layered architecture**—are fundamental to both processes.

## Application Startup Workflow

When a Spring Boot application starts, it follows a defined sequence to initialize and prepare the application:

1. **Entry point (main method)**  
   The process begins with a standard Java `main` method, which invokes `SpringApplication.run()`.  

2. **SpringApplication initialization**  
   The `run()` method creates a `SpringApplication` instance, which configures default settings based on the classpath.  

3. **Environment setup**  
   Spring Boot loads properties from various sources (e.g., `application.properties`, `application.yml`, command-line arguments) to prepare the application's environment.  

4. **ApplicationContext creation**  
   Spring Boot creates an **Inversion of Control (IoC) container**, also known as the `ApplicationContext`, to manage the application's beans.  

5. **Auto-configuration**  
   The `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation (part of `@SpringBootApplication`) triggers auto-configuration.  
   - Spring Boot scans the classpath for dependencies (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web` for a web app).  
   - Beans are configured automatically based on available libraries, minimizing manual setup.  

6. **Component scanning**  
   The `@ComponentScan` annotation (also part of `@SpringBootApplication`) scans for classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`, and registers them as beans in the `ApplicationContext`.  

7. **Embedded server startup**  
   For web applications, Spring Boot starts an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.), which listens for incoming requests (default port: **8080**).  

8. **Application is ready**  
   The application is now fully initialized and ready to handle requests.

## Web Request Handling Workflow

Once the application is running, it processes incoming web requests through this workflow:

1. **Request from client**  
   A client (browser or API) sends an HTTP request (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) to the application.  

2. **DispatcherServlet interception**  
   The request is intercepted by Spring's central `DispatcherServlet`, acting as a **front controller**. Spring Boot auto-configures this servlet.  

3. **Handler mapping**  
   The `DispatcherServlet` consults a **Handler Mapping** to find the correct controller method based on URL and HTTP method.  

4. **Controller processing**  
   The appropriate method (annotated with `@RestController` or `@Controller`) is invoked.  

5. **Service layer (business logic)**  
   The controller delegates to a `@Service` component, which contains the core business logic.  

6. **Persistence layer (data access)**  
   The service layer calls a `@Repository` component to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against the database.  

7. **Response generation**  
   The controller method returns a value, which Spring converts into an HTTP response.  
   - For REST APIs, this often involves converting a Java object to JSON using a **MessageConverter**.  

8. **Response to client**  
   The `DispatcherServlet` sends the final HTTP response back to the client.

## Layered Architecture

The workflow is underpinned by a layered architecture that keeps applications organized and maintainable:

- **Presentation Layer**  
  Handles HTTP requests and responses, request mapping, JSON conversion, and authentication.  

- **Business Layer (Service Layer)**  
  Contains business logic and orchestrates interactions between presentation and persistence layers.  

- **Persistence Layer**  
  Manages database access and translation between Java objects and database rows.  

- **Database Layer**  
  The underlying database technology that stores the application's data.
